                Hi, my name is Sarah (they/them). As a Fullstack Academy
                graduate with 5+ years of retail experience, including ecommerce
                fulfillment and receiving, I bring a unique perspective to web
                development that prioritizes user experience and streamlined
                functionality.

                In my ecommerce role at a bookstore, I found myself frequently
                talking customers through the same confusing parts of the
                store’s website and often wished I could go to the source and
                make the site more intuitive. When I decided it was time to make
                a big career change, a friend suggested I might enjoy learning
                how to code. I started learning on my own during small pockets
                of free time, then in the fall of 2022 I decided to take the
                leap and apply for Fullstack Academy’s part-time web development
                bootcamp. It’s been a whirlwind from there!
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Those who have worked with me would say my strengths include
                reliability, intellectual focus and an ability to work well with
                many different kinds of people. I have experience with Node,
                Javascript, React/Redux, Git, Express, HTML5, and PostgreSQL,
                and have worked independently and with teams to develop several
                full-stack projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                I am passionate about web development and eager to explore new
                opportunities in the book, audio, and ecommerce industries. I
                can’t wait to continue to learn and contribute my technical
                skills to creating sleek, seamless products that people love to
                use.
